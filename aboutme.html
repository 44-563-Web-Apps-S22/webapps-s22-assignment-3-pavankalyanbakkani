        <h4> 8 MILE </h4>
        <p> The movie is called 8-mile because it is where Eminem grew up,it's an Oscar award winning movie for song "LOSE YOURSELF".
            the section of the road that the movie is referring to (it's a big road and there's actually some nice parts of it) is stricken with poverty and total societal breakdown.
            At the age 0f  14 he started rapping, in the beginning he was mocked by westcoast african rappers as he was in the fear of failure he's choked to do a rap and after going through
            lot of rap  battles eventually, he ripped down the papadoc with his skills during the final rap  battle with the papadoc who is no.1 on other side. (Bollywood movie:"apna time ayega" inspired by 8 mile)
             A true story of eminem about <b>"OVERCOMING THE FEAR OF FAILURE"</b>. A quote to remember for this life

           <b><br> "you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow,coz opportunity comes once in a life time  go" </br></b>
