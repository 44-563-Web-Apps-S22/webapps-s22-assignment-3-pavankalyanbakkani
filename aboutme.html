        <h4> 8 MILE /h4>
        <p> The movie is called 8-mile because it is where Eminem grew up,it's an Oscar award winning movie for song "LOSE YOURSELF".
            the section of the road that the movie is referring to (it's a big road and there's actually some nice parts of it) is stricken with poverty and total societal breakdown.
            At the age 0f  14 he started rapping, in the beginning he was mocked by westcoast african rappers as he was in the fear of failure he's choked and after going through
            lot of rap  battles eventually he ripped down the papadoc who is no.1 on other side. (Bollywood movie:"apna time ayega" inspired by 8 mile)
